# BlockHarbor Protocol

## Overview

BlockHarbor Protocol is a comprehensive framework designed for digital resource management and secure, conditional transfers of digital assets. Built on Clarity, a smart contract language for the Stacks blockchain, BlockHarbor ensures multi-party verification and robust lifecycle management for digital lockers, resources, and assets.

The protocol facilitates multi-phase resource allocations, cryptographic transaction verification, metadata recording, and more, providing full transparency and control over digital asset movements.

## Features

- **Conditional Transfers**: Execute resource transfers only when predefined conditions are met.
- **Multi-party Verification**: Ensures that all relevant parties approve of resource movement.
- **Locker Management**: Create, manage, and terminate digital lockers containing valuable resources.
- **Phased Resource Allocation**: Set up multi-phase digital asset distributions over time.
- **Cryptographic Validation**: Attach and verify cryptographic proofs to each resource transaction for additional security.
- **Metadata Attachment**: Attach metadata to lockers for enhanced resource tracking and evidence collection.
- **Dispute Resolution**: Mechanisms to contest lockers and distribute assets in case of disputes.

## Contract Functions

- **Resource Transfer**: Execute transfers from lockers to beneficiaries with multi-party authorization.
- **Prolong Locker Lifecycle**: Extend the time frame for locker activity if needed.
- **Contested Lockers**: Flag lockers for disputes and resolve them through protocol-based adjudication.
- **Cryptographic Validation**: Attach cryptographic proofs to verify transaction authenticity.
- **Oversight Registration**: Register additional oversight for high-value lockers to ensure security and compliance.

## Setup

### Requirements

- A working Stacks blockchain environment with Clarity smart contracts enabled.
- Access to a Clarity-compatible wallet for interacting with the protocol.

### Deployment

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile and deploy the Clarity smart contracts using your preferred method (e.g., Stacks CLI or Stacks wallet).
3. Interact with the protocol using Clarity contract calls for managing resources, lockers, and allocations.

### Example Usage

```clarity
;; Create a new resource locker
(define-public (create-locker (originator principal) (beneficiary principal) (quantity uint) (resource-type uint))
  ;; Define locker creation logic
)
```
